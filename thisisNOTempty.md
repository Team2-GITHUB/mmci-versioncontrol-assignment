## Description of Use Case

Version control on the enterprise level can help ensure proper relationships with clients within a consulting firm. Different projects will ostensibly have unique solutions, but these solutions may be applied elsewhere and version control would detail who helped on the project and what they did. When another similar project is picked up, a possible solution could be found through version control.

Addtionally, version control can help track relationships over time with individual clients. That way if a new project is introduced, the consultant assigned to that project can check the client's record and see the work that was done for that client and the relationship of the client to the firm and how it has changed over time. People who have left, joined or moved up in the client firm would be tracked through version control.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
version control is kind of a "database" that lets you save a snapshot of your complete project anytime you want.it lets you work with any tools that you like. it doesnt care what kind of text editor, graphic program, file manager, or other tools that you use.

## Why is it a good use of version control (Git/Github)?

It's very important because, if you loose your data/files, you can generally recover it easily.
This is a good use of version control firstly because there are many changes taking place within firms, and the more a consultant can keep up with and see those changes over time, the better they will know and serve their client. Secondly, version control can accelerate learnings throughougt the consulting firm. For example, if a project that was done a year ago is similar to a new project, version control can allow the consultant to find procedures and results from the older project and apply it to the new one.  Every version is essentially a clone and full backup of the files, even if the server the original files were saved to become obsolete. 

Being able to restore older versions of a file (or even the whole project) effectively means one thing: you can't mess up! If the changes you've made lately prove to be garbage, you can simply undo them in a few clicks. Knowing this should make you a lot more relaxed when working on important bits of a project.



Additionally, using version control you can look back and see who made what changes. That way, you can go and consult with a specific colleague about a project. Version control makes it easy to find out who added what information so that you can go ask follow-up questions about a specific change or product.

## Where does it fall short in leveraging version control tools?
It doesn't support checking out sub-trees, the central would need to be setup for multiple per package repositories for each project rather than a project wide repository.

its also harder to use it when you need to fetch a very large repository with huge commit history, just in order to see the source or do a simple patch.
It doesn't track empty folders.

Version control tools, especially github, require users to learn an extra skillset and language, making the current tools not user friendly. 

## What would you do differently?

In this case, an alternative to version control could be a plug-in that works with our CRM to track changes and report out regularly about the changes that were made in the past week.

It would also be nice if the product was easier to use and users didn't have to learn code or abstruse terms to use the product.

Overall, version control would be a fantastic tool if there were a user interface that was built for non-programmers.

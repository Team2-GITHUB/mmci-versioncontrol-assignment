Description of Use Case

Version control on the enterprise level can help ensure proper relationships with clients within a consulting firm. Different projects will ostensibly have unique solutions, but these solutions may be applied elsewhere and version control would detail who helped on the project and what they did. When another similar project is picked up, a possible solution could be found through version control.
Addtionally, version control can help track relationships over time with individual clients. That way if a new project is introduced, the consultant assigned to that project can check the client's record and see the work that was done for that client and the relationship of the client to the firm and how it has changed over time. People who have left, joined or moved up in the client firm would be tracked through version control. 

Why is it a good use of version control (Git/Github)?
This is a good use of version control firstly because there are many changes taking place within firms, and the more a consultant can keep up with and see those changes over time, the better they will know and serve their client. Secondly, version control can accelerate learnings throughougt the consulting firm. For example, if a project that was done a year ago is similar to a new project, version control can allow the consultant to find procedures and results from the older project and apply it to the new one.
